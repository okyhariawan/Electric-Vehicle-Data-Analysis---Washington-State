# Electric Vehicle Data Analysis - Washington State

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook focused on analyzing a dataset of electric vehicles (EVs) registered in Washington State. The analysis includes data cleaning, descriptive statistics, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights about EV adoption, vehicle characteristics, and trends.

## Introduction

Electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming increasingly popular due to their environmental benefits and advancements in technology. This notebook analyzes data on EVs registered in Washington State, exploring various aspects such as make, model, electric range, and eligibility for clean alternative fuel vehicle incentives.

## Objective

The primary objectives of this analysis are:

- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Prepare the dataset for analysis by handling missing values, checking for duplicates, and understanding the structure and types of data available.
- **Descriptive Analysis**: Summarize the key characteristics of the data, including distributions of numerical and categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Provide deeper insights into the dataset through visualizations, focusing on patterns and trends related to EV registrations and vehicle characteristics.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis includes detailed information about EVs registered in Washington State. It contains attributes such as:

- Vehicle make and model
- Electric vehicle type (e.g., battery electric, plug-in hybrid)
- Electric range
- Manufacturer details
- Eligibility for clean alternative fuel vehicle incentives

## Analysis Steps

1. **Import Libraries**: Load necessary Python libraries for data analysis and visualization.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Process the dataset to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and ensure data types are correctly formatted.
3. **Descriptive Statistics**: Compute and visualize basic statistics to understand the distribution and key characteristics of the data.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conduct a detailed exploration of the dataset using various visualizations to identify trends and patterns in EV registrations and characteristics.
